## Rotation for matrix
> Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

Example:    
> 1 2 3 4   
5 6 7 8   
9 10 11 12    
> 13 14 15 16    
After =>     
> 4 8 12 16    
3 7 11 15    
2 6 10 14    
> 1 5 9 13

## Rotation for string
> Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring ( i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).

**rotation of string => "water"  (rotated by two character) => "terwa"**
