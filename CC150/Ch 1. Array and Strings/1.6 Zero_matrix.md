## 1.6 Zero Matrix
> Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.

Example 1:      
> Input:       
[      
  [1,1,1],      
  [1,0,1],      
  [1,1,1]      
]      
Output:       
[      
  [1,0,1],      
  [0,0,0],      
  [1,0,1]      
> ]
