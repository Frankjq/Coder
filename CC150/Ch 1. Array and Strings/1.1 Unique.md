## CC 1.1
> Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has ***all unique*** characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?

### linear time solution

**based on the size of character set, we decide the size of array.    
if it is ASCII, the size is 256.   
if it is only lowercase character, the size is 26.    
declare a array to record all character, and if the letter has been recorded, mark as true, otherwise, the string is not unique.    
The time complexity is O(n).** 


```java
class Solution {
    public boolean uniqueLetterString(String S) {
       	boolean [] ch = new boolean [256];
        for(int i = 0; i< S.length(); i++){
            if(ch[S.charAt(i)]) return false;
            ch[S.charAt(i)] = true;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
